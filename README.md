# Advent_rust

This is me just practicing some rust!

All of the coding challenges i used can be found at [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021).
This repo is full of coding challenges, with a common theme that are great for practicing languages you aren't super fluent in!

The goal of this is to increase my rust proficiency and utilize more of the language.
